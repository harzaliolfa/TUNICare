# About the model
The datasets of mental desorder desease are rare.
We spent a lot of time searching the approriate dataset to our idea
we did the data preprocessing in order to adapt it to our project
We tried to find the best model that will give us a hight accuracy
We used Logistic Regression model to our dataset and  gridSearchCv to ameliorate our model parameters
We get a good accuracy 84% a great value according to the small dataset that we have and the non-perfect features
We loaded the model and then we import it to a web app using flask 
We linkes our frontend(Bootstrap) and the backend to make it easier to the user
